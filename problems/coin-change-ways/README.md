# Coin change ways

You have `m` types of coins available in infinite quantities where the value of each coin is given in the array C = [c<sub>0</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, ..., c<sub>m-1</sub>]. Can you determine the number of ways of making change for `n` units using the given types of coins? For example, if coins `C= [1, 2, 3]`, we can make change for `n = 3` units in three ways: `{1, 1, 1}`, `{1, 2}`, and `{3}`.

Given `n` and an array of coins, return the number of ways to make change for `n` units.

Sample Input
